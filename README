Documentation
-----------------------------------------------

This module stores stock levels seperate from the products themsleves. This means that a history of stock levels can be
produced. The module also stores different types of stock updates - manual, and order based.

The module also includes a MinMaxModifier, which will make sure that a product quantity in cart stays between a min and a max.

The MinMaxModifier can also be used on its own!

This module provides a stock control page for quick updating of stock levels. This may be refactored into the CMS.

About the model classes:

ProductStockCalculatedQuantity: works out the quantity available for each product based on the the number of items
sold (recorded in ProductStockOrderEntry) and manual corrections, recorded in ProductStockManualUpdate.

ProductStockVariationCalculatedQuantity: calculates quantities available for product variations as opposed to products.

ProductStockOrderEntry: keeps a record of the quantity deduction made for each sale. That is, if we sell 10 items
in an order then an entry is made in this dataclass for a reduction of ten widgets in the available quantity.

ProductStockManualUpdate: at any stage, the product available quantity can be changed (manually overridden) using this class.




Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.
2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module at all, but instead customise
it from your mysite folder, so that you can upgrade the module without redoing the settings.

If you just want one or two things from this module
then of course you are free to copy them to your
mysite folder and delete the rest of this module.

Make sure you name the module root folder 'ecommerce_stockcontrol'. This will enable requirements to be included properly.


copy the lines between the START and END line to your /mysite/_config.php file and choose the right settings
